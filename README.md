# TRPO + GAE

An implementation of Trust Region Policy Optimization (Schulman 2015) with Generalized Advantage Estimation (Schulman 2016). This implementation can handle environments with both discrete and continuous action spaces.

# Plans to improve this repository:

* Add support for policies using either CNNs or MLPs
* Add plots of rewards
* Add videos of learned locomotion
* Add support for vine simulation as described in (Schulman 2015)
